    <h1>The Basic Toolset</h1>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.checkForHTML5()</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      Returns <i>true</i> if the browser appears to support HTML5 and <i>false</i> if it doesn't.
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.html5Message()</div>
    <div class="function-description">

      Checks to see if the browser supports HTML5 and if it doesn't, looks for an element in the
      page with the id <i>"gp-upgrade"</i> and displays a message recommending that the user upgrade
      their browser to the 21st century.
      <br><br>
      Note that this function is automatically called on document load meaning there will never be a
      reason to call it directly. To take advantage, you only need to put an element (such as a DIV
      or SPAN) in your document with the id <i>"gp-upgrade"</i> as follows:
      <div class="code">&lt;span id="gp-upgrade"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</div>
      With that element in place, the rest is automatic. Honestly ... at this point none of these
      websites are money making ventures for me so I have no interest in supporting someone who
      won't accept a free browser upgrade in order to get an up to date web experience. I mean
      really!
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.emailLink(id, user, host, link)</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      Inserts an email into your HTML in such a way that makes it difficult for spam bots to find.
      <div class="code">
        <b>id</b> - id of the element to add the email link to.<br>
        <b>user</b> - user name portion of the email address.<br>
        <b>domain</b> - domain name portion of the email address.<br>
        <b>link</b> - <i>[optional]</i> link text (defaults = email address).
      </div>
      To use this function, you first need an element in the page where the address will be placed
      and that element must have an id.
      <div class="code">&lt;span id="mail-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</div>
      Next the function needs to be called. The arguments to the function are the element id, the
      user name, the domain name, and the optional link text. As an example, if I wanted to send an
      email to glenn@gp_tools.com, I would call:
      <div class="code">Gp.Basic.emailLink("mail-link", "glenn", "gp_tools.com");</div>
      Or if I wanted something besides the email address as the link text, I would add that as a
      fourth argument.
      <div class="code">Gp.Basic.emailLink("mail-link", "glenn", "gp_tools.com", "Email me here.");</div>
      The result should look something like:
      <br><br>
      Email: <span id="mail-link"></span>
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.fixEmailLinks()</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      Looks for all elements in a page using the class <i>"gp-send-mail"</i> and for each element
      found, inserts an email link into the element using custom data attributes specified on the
      element itself. Like the previous function, the email is inserted in such a way that makes
      it difficult for spam bots to find.
      <br><br>
      Note that this function is automatically called on document load meaning there will never be
      a reason to call it directly. To take advantage, you need to specify an element (usually a
      SPAN element) in your document for each email link in the page. Each of those elements must
      use the class <i>"gp-send-mail"</i>. At a minimum, each element must contain a custom attribute
      for the user name and another custom attribute for the domain name. You can also specify an
      optional third custom attribute containing the link text. If you leave that last attribute
      off, the email address will be used.
      <br><br>
      So let's say you want put in an email link just like in the last function, you would need
      only the following HTML.
      <div class="code">
        &lt;span class="gp-send-mail" data-user="glenn" data-domain="gp_tools.com"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      </div>
      Or if you wanted an additional link but wanted to specify link text other than the email
      address, you can add a custom attribute for that as in the following.
      <div class="code">
        &lt;span class="gp-send-mail" data-user="glenn" data-domain="gp_tools.com" data-link="Mail here!"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      </div>
      That's it. The function is called automatically on document load leaving the two elements to
      display as follows:
      <br><br>
      <span class="gp-send-mail" data-user="glenn" data-domain="gp_tools.com"></span><br>
      <span class="gp-send-mail" data-user="glenn" data-domain="gp_tools.com" data-link="Mail here!"></span>
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.insertCopyright()</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      Looks for an element with the id <i>"gp-copyright"</i> and if such an element is found,
      inserts a copyright message into that element based on the year of today's date.
      <br><br>
      Note that this function is automatically called on document load meaning there will never be
      a reason to call it directly. To take advantage, you need an element (such as a DIV or SPAN
      in your document with the id <i>"gp-copyright"</i>. Additionally, you need to specify who to
      attribute the copyright to. This can be done through an additional attribute on the element
      <i>"data-who"</i>. So if I want to attribute a copyright to myself, I would put the following
      in my page:
      <div class="code">&lt;span id="gp-copyright" data-who="Glenn Poorman"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</div>
      With that element in place, the rest is automatic. See the very bottom of this page to see
      what the output looks like.
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.openWindow(url, width, height, scrollbars)</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      Allows for another browser window to be opened using a specified url.
      <div class="code">
        <b>url</b> - url of the file to open in the new browser window.<br>
        <b>width</b> - width of new browser window.<br>
        <b>height</b> - height of new browser window.<br>
        <b>scrollbars</b> - <i>[optional]</i> display scrollbars ("true" or "false").
      </div>
      This function can be called from another script or can be called right in the page. I've
      frequently used this function in the <i>"onclick"</i> handler for an HTML anchor. The link
      below was written:
      <div class="code">
        &lt;a href="#noop" onclick="Gp.Basic.openWindow('popup.html',500,600,true);"&gt;Click Me&lt;/a&gt;
      </div>
      Click the link below and watch the new window open up.
      <br><br>
      <a href="#noop" onclick="Gp.Basic.openWindow('popup.html',500,600,true);">Click Me</a>
      <br><br>
      Before <i>LightBox</i> came along, I used to use this to popup full sized images from
      thumbnails.
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.randomImage(id, howmany, location, suffix)</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      The random image function allows the website developer to display one out of a collection of
      images but have the specific image in the collection chosen at random every time the page is
      reloaded.
      <div class="code">
        <b>id</b> - id of the &lt;img&gt; element that will display the random image.<br>
        <b>howmany</b> - number of images in the collection to choose from.<br>
        <b>location</b> - location of the images (optional, default = same as page).<br>
        <b>suffix</b> - <i>[optional]</i> suffix of the image file (default = "jpg").
      </div>
      In order for this to work, the images must all reside in the same location, must be of the
      same format (all of the file suffixes must match), and must follow a specific naming criteria.
      The images must be named using the image element id followed by a dash and a 1-based index.
      For example, if you have a collection of six images and the name you pass in is "picture",
      then it will be assumed that your collection of images looks like:
      <div class="code">
        picture-1.jpg<br>
        picture-2.jpg<br>
        picture-3.jpg<br>
        picture-4.jpg<br>
        picture-5.jpg<br>
        picture-6.jpg<br>
      </div>
      Next, is the image placement. This is done by simply putting an IMG element in your page and
      setting the element id to the common image name (minus any extra digits). Note that this is
      crucial. If the id and the name do not match, nothing will display. Going back to the six
      image collection shown above then, you would put the following in your page:
      <div class="code">&lt;img id="picture"&gt;</div>
      Lastly you need to call the function. This can either be done inline within a &lt;script&gt;
      tag or it can be done in the document ready function. I prefer the latter as it allows the
      rest of the page to load before downloading the image.
      <div class="code">Gp.Basic.randomImage("picture", 6, ".", "jpg");</div>
      Note that since the last argument defaults to "jpg" and the files shown here are "jpg" files,
      this code could be written:
      <div class="code">Gp.Basic.randomImage("picture", 6, ".");</div>
      Lastly, since the location parameter is also optional and defaults to the same location as
      the page, we could have written:
      <div class="code">Gp.Basic.randomImage("picture", 6);</div>
      The result is shown below. Refresh the page to watch the image change.
      <br><br>
      <img id="picture">
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Basic.simpleImage(id, caption, thumbscale, float, description)</div>
    <div class="function-description">
    <div id="picture-1"></div>
      <h4>Requires <i>LightBox</i></h4>
      The simple image function is used to place a simple popup image into a web page. The single
      image file is displayed as a thumbnail by applying the scale parameter to the original width
      and height of the image. A link is also created so that the image will display at its default
      size when clicked. This function uses <i>"LightBox"</i> to display the image and it is assumed
      that the lightbox JS and CSS files are loaded.
      <div class="code">
        <b>id</b> - id of the element to contain the image and the url of the image file.<br>
        <b>caption</b> - caption to display under the thumbnail image.<br>
        <b>thumbscale</b> - scale applied to image width and height for thumbnail display.<br>
        <b>float</b> - <i>[optional]</i> CSS "float" property to set on the element (default = "none").<br>
        <b>description</b> - <i>[optional]</i> text that will appear in the window when the image is selected.
      </div>
      Placement is done by putting a DIV element in your page and setting the id of the element to
      the relative image url. The file suffix on the element id is optional. If no suffix is given,
      ".jpg" is assumed.
      <br><br>
      The picture on the upper right (for example), is "picture-1.jpg" from the collection above.
      The element for that picture could be written in one of two ways:
      <div class="code">&lt;div id="picture-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div>
      Since the default file suffix is "jpg", the element could also be written:
      <div class="code">&lt;div id="picture-1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div>
      Note that when the function call is made, the ids must match exactly.
      <br><br>
      <div id="picture-2"></div>
      Next, the function must be called for each image in your page. For the image we just talked
      about then, the function call would look like:
      <div class="code">Gp.Basic.simpleImage("picture-1.jpg", "Simple Image", 0.4, "right", "Some dandelions");</div>
      Or if you left the file suffix off:
      <div class="code">Gp.Basic.simpleImage("picture-1", "Simple Image", 0.4, "right", "Some dandelions");</div>
      The arguments are the id/url followed by a caption that will be displayed just under the
      image. Note that as in the element placement, the file suffix is optional but it is important
      to note that the id in the function call and the id in the DIV element must match exactly. The
      next argument is the scale that is applied to the image width and height in order to display
      the thumbnail. Last is the float property. This can have any value that the CSS <i>"float"</i>
      property can have. The argument can also be left off in which case the default of <i>"none"</i>
      will be used.

      <h4>CSS</h4>
      The <i>simpleImage</i> function will automatically add the class <i>gp-simple-image</i> to the
      containing element allowing control over all manner of formatting options. The default style
      is shown below:
      <div class="code-pre">
      .gp-simple-image
      {
        text-align : center;
      }
      </div>
      Note the two images floated in these paragraphs. Click either image and watch lightbox display
      the full size image.
    </div>
  </div>
