    <h1>HTML Audio Album</h1>
    <h4>Utilities for displaying audio elements in a page using <i>MediaElement</i></h4>

    Like the <i>SlideShow</i> vs <i>SlideDeck</i> discussion, the audio player tools work great for
    scattering audio elements on a web page and having complete control over each elements position
    in relation to the other content on the page. Sometimes though, you want to essentially create
    an album on the page. A no frills container that holds all of the elements in a collection all
    grouped in one place. Similar to the <i>SlideDeck</i> tools, a strategically marked element in
    the page is all you need and the tools will handle the rest.

    <h4>audio.json</h4>
    All of the data for the audio elements must be put into a JSON file for the album tools to work.
    The format of the JSON file is exactly like the format in the
    <a href="../gp.audioplayer.js">gp.audioplayer</a> discussion. One difference to note here though
    is that the previously unused <i>"title"</i> property in the collection JSON will be used here
    but only if specified. The property itself is still optional.

    <h4>The HTML</h4>
    With the album, you no longer need to create elemenets in your HTML for each audio file. For
    this to work, it is simply a matter of placing a single container element for the entire album.
    <div class="code">&lt;div id="gp-audio-album"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div>
    When the <i>"fromJSON"</i> function is called, the code will automatically look for an element
    with the id "gp-audio-album" and automatically create the individual audio elements in order
    within that container. In addition, if a "title" is specified on the JSON collection, an
    additional <i>DIV</i> element will be created and the title will be inserted.
    <br><br>
    That's it!

    <h4>Customization</h4>
    In addition to the styles that can be used to customize the look of the individual audio
    elements, two style definitions can be used to customize the appearance of the album. The album
    itself must have the id <i>"gp-audio-album"</i>. In addition, if a title is present the DIV
    element that will contain the title will automatically have the class <i>"gp-audio-album-title"</i>
    applied to it. By default, the style for the class <i>"gp-audio-album-title"</i> looks as follows:
    <div class="code-pre">
    .gp-audio-album-title
    {
      font-size     : 1.5em;
      margin-bottom : 0.5em;
    }
    </div>
    That style can, of course, be further customized as can the style for the main
    <i>"gp-audio-album"</i> container. In this sample, we have customized the style as follows:
    <div class="code-pre">
    #gp-audio-album
    {
      background : #303060;
      border-radius : 8px;
      color : #CCC;
      padding : 1.0em;
      padding-bottom : 0.5em;
      width : 400px;
    }
    </div>

    <div id="gp-audio-album"></div>
  </div>
