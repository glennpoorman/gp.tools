    <h1>Modal YouTube Video Player</h1>
    <h4>Utilities for playing a YouTube vide in a modal window using <i>modal-video</i></h4>

    Using the modal video utilities, you can create nice visual links to any YouTube videos
    and, when selected, have those videos play in their own modal window within the web
    page. Setting up the page is a matter of specifying a container element in the HTML
    for every desired video link and filling in the details for the link using either a
    JavaScript call or a JSON file of video objects. If the file is named <i>video.json</i>,
    it will be automatically loaded on document load.

    <div class="function-title">Gp.ModalVideo.addVideo(id, video);</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      <h4>Requires <i>modal-video</i></h4>
      Adds a video link to the page as a child of the given container element using the data in
      the given JSON video object.
      <div class="code">
        <b>id</b> - id of the container element where the video element will be inserted.<br>
        <b>video</b> - JSON video object contains the video data.
      </div>
      <div class="code-pre">
      {
        /* [required] YouTube video id.
         * @type String
         */
        "vid" : null,

        /* [required] Path to thumbnail image.
         * @type String
         */
        "thumb" : null,

        /* [required] Title.
         * @type String
         */
        "title" : null,

        /* [optional] Description.
         * @type String
         */
        "desc" : null
      }
      </div>

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      To use the <i>addVideo</i> function, the page needs a container element (preferably a DIV)
      for the video link and the element must have a unique id.
      <div class="code-pre">
      &lt;div id="some-id"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
      With any container elements in place, the video elements are inserted by calling the
      <i>addVideo</i> function for each container at the bottom of the page after all of the
      requisite JS files have been pulled in.
      <div class="code-pre">
      Gp.ModalVideo.addVideo("some-id",
        {
          "vid" : "vq78BDwCujs",
          "thumb" : "ififell.jpg",
          "title" : "If I Fell",
          "desc" : "From \"A Hard Day's Night\""
        }
      );
      </div>
      <div id="some-id"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.ModalVideo.fromJSON(jsonURL);</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      <h4>Requires <i>modal-video</i></h4>
      Loads a series of video objects from the specified JSON file and adds the video elements
      to elements on the current web page.
      <div class="code">
        <b>jsonURL</b> - url of the JSON file to load.
      </div>
      <div class="code-pre">
      {
        /* [optional] Common id of all container elements minus the index.
         * @type String (default = "gp-modal-video")
         */
        "prefix" : null,

        /* [required] Video data.
         * @type Array of modal video objects
         * Same format as object in <i>addVideo</i>
         */
        "data" :
        [
          {
            modal video 1
          },
          {
            modal video n
          },
        ]
      }
      </div>
      If you have several video elements in your page, using <i>addVideo</i> for each element can
      get quite messy. Using <i>fromJSON</i> allows you to simply put the video containers in your
      page, define all of the video objects in a JSON file, and make one call to put it all together.

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      The setup in your HTML is pretty much the same as in <i>addVideo</i> except that the
      formatting of the container element ids is a little more strict. Ideally you will have as
      many container elements in your page as there are video objects in the JSON file. The id
      of each element must be <i>"prefix-n"</i> where <i>"prefix"</i> is a JSON property and
      <i>"n"</i> is the 1-based index of the video object in the array. Suppose then that you
      wanted to put three video objects in your page. You would start by laying out those objects
      in your JSON file as follows.
      <div class="code-pre">
      { "prefix" : "video-container",
        "data"   :
        [
          {
            "vid" : "GlX0DzaEIaM",
            "thumb" : "nightbefore.jpg",
            "title" : "The Night Before",
            "desc" : "From Help!"
          },
          {
            "vid" : "yYvkICbTZIQ",
            "title" : "Paperback Writer",
            "thumb" : "paperback.jpg",
            "desc" : "Official music video"
          },
          {
            "vid": H"tUH9z_Oey8",
            "title" : "Strawberry Fields Forever",
            "thumb" : "strawberry.jpg",
            "desc" : "Official music video"
          }
        ]
      }
      </div>
      The next step would be to put the container elements in your HTML. The elements don't have to
      be grouped together. The only thing that matters is that they exist and have the correct id
      format. Again note the id matches the <i>"prefix"</i> property from the JSON followed by a
      dash and the index of the item in the array.
      <div class="code-pre">
      &lt;div id="video-container-1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="video-container-2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="video-container-3"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
      With the JSON file and the container elements all in place, putting it all together is now
      simply a matter of making a single JavaScript call at the bottom of your page to load the
      file and insert the video elements.
      <div class="code-pre">
      Gp.ModalVideo.fromJSON("myvideo.json");
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">video.json</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      By taking special care in naming your JSON file, you can make things even easier. When the
      file <i>gp.tools.js</i> is loaded, the location of the page is automatically scanned for a
      file named <i>video.json</i>. If it is found, then it is loaded automatically.
      <h4>Usage</h4>
      The HTML and the contents of the file are exactly the same as with the <i>fromJSON</i>
      description. Here, however, you make sure the name of the JSON file is <i>video.json</i>.
      Remove the call to <i>fromJSON</i> from your script section as this will now happen
      automatically.
      <br><br>
      That's it!
      <br><br>
      <div id="video-container-1"></div>
      <div id="video-container-2"></div>
      <div id="video-container-3"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <div class="function-description">
      Like the other utilities, there are some styles included in <i>gp.tools.css</i> that are used
      in the modal video code. You can use these styles as is or override them as you see fit.
      <br><br>
      When a video link is added to the page, the style <i>.gp-video-container</i> is automatically
      applied to the container element. The default implementation sets the display type to make the
      element easier to manipulate and float.
      <div class="code-pre">
      .gp-video-container
      {
        clear          : both;
        overflow       : auto;
        padding        : 6px;
        vertical-align : middle;
        text-align     : left;
      }
      </div>
      Three other styles are also available for modification.
      <div class="code">
        <b>.gp-video-button</b> - the element containing the thumbnail and play button.<br>
        <b>.gp-play-button</b> - the play button image that overlays the thumbnail.<br>
        <b>.gp-play-button-small</b> - the play button image that overlays thumbnails less than 320 pixels wide.
      </div>
      There really shouldn't be much reason to play with these but there's never any harm in
      experimenting.
    </div>
