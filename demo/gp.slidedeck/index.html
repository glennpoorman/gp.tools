    <h1>LightBox Slide Show Part 2</h1>
    <h4>Utilities for presenting a slide show in a single page as a series of clickable thumbnails.</h4>

    The slide show code works great for scattering slides all over the place in a given web page
    and grouping all of those slides into a single <i>LightBox</i> collection. You have full control
    over where your slides are located and how they are floated. Sometimes though, you just want to
    display every slide in the group a one big clump. One container element that holds all of the
    thumbnails without anything else. Of course that is easy to do yourself using the slide show
    tools but the slide deck part of these tools simplifies things even more to the point where the
    only HTML you need is the container itself. That, along with the file <i>slides.json</i> and
    the image files on disk is enough to make it all work.

    <h4>slides.json</h4>
    All of the data for the slides must be put into a file called <i>"slides.json"</i> for the slide
    deck to work. The format for the JSON is exactly like the format in the
    <a href="../gp.slideshow/index.html">gp.slideshow</a> discussion. In the slide deck however, it
    is best not to use the "float" property for any of your slides.

    <h4>The HTML</h4>
    With the slide deck, you no longer need to create elements in your HTML for each slide. For this
    to work, it is simply a matter of placing a container element for the entire collection.
    <div class="code">&lt;div id="gp-slide-deck"&gt;&lt/div&gt;</div>
    Like with the slide show code, we will automatically call <i>"fromJSON"</i> to load up the file
    <i>"slides.json"</i> on document load. That code will look for an element with the id
    <i>"gp-slide-deck"</i> though and automatically create the individual slide elements in order
    within that container. So there's nothing else for you to do here.

    <h4>Customization</h4>
    The included CSS file <i>gp.tools.css</i> contains a style definition for anything with the
    id <i>"gp-slide-deck"</i>. The default implementation is:
    <div class="code-pre">
    #gp-slide-deck
    {
      text-align : center;
    }
    </div>
    Like anything else, you are free to override and customize however you see fit. In the sample
    shown below, we added the following properties to the style.
    <div class="code-pre">
    #gp-slide-deck
    {
      margin : 16px auto;
      max-width : 800px;
    }
    </div>
    Here we set the margins for a bit of padding above and below as well as centering the container
    in the page. Lastly, we set a max width so the container can never go above 800 pixels but will
    shrink for a smaller window or a mobile device.
