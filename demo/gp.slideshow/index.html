    <h1>LightBox Slide Show Part 1</h1>
    <h4>Utilities for presenting a slide show in a single page as a series of clickable thumbnails.</h4>

    Using the slideshow utilities, you can create a webpage that includes a set of images grouped
    together into a single <i>LightBox</i> collection. Any or all of those images can be displayed
    as thumbnails on the page. Clicking any of the thumbnails will use <i>LightBox</i> to bring up
    the full size image and allow the user to cycle through the entire collection. Setting up the
    page is a matter of specifying a container element (a DIV is preferred) in the HTML for every
    slide in the set and either calling the function <i>addSlide</i> to fill in the details or by
    specifying all of the info for the page in a JSON file. If the file is named <i>slides.json</i>,
    it will be automatically loaded on document load.

    <h2>SlideShow vs SlideDeck</h2>
    <div class="function-description">
      The slide show tools provide two ways to present slides. The first is the <i>slide show</i>
      which allows you to sprinkle your slides throughout a document placing them anywhere you like.
      This is a good way to, for example, write a paper about something and provide small thumbnails
      throughout the paper that you can click on for the larger image. What separates this from the
      <i>simpleImage</i> function described in <i>Gp.Basic</i> is that multiple images can be grouped
      together so that if you click one, the entire collection opens in <i>LightBox</i> and you can
      cycle through them. In addition, you can hide images. In other words, consider you have a page
      and you have twenty slides to go with it. You want all twenty slides to be available in the
      collection when you're using <i>LightBox</i> to cycle but maybe you only want to display six
      image thumbnails in the page. With the slide show you can put all twenty in the page but the
      ones you don't want to see can be hidden.
      <br><br>
      So how does this all work?
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Slideshow.addSlide(id, group, slide);</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      <div id="my-picture-1"></div>
      <div id="my-picture-2"></div>
      Inserts an image into a container element and also adds the image into a lightbox collection.
      <div class="code">
        <b>id</b> - id of the container element where the image will be inserted.<br>
        <b>group</b> - the name of the LightBox collection to put the image in.<br>
        <b>slide</b> - JSON slide object.
      </div>
      <div class="code-pre">
      {
        /* [optional] Url to image file.
         * @type String (default = "id.jpg")
         * Default is created by using the input id and assuming the file type is JPG.
         */
        "url" : null,

        /* [optional] Thumbnail caption.
         * @type String
         */
        "caption" : null,

        /* [optional] Full window description.
         * @type String
         */
        "description" : null,

        /* [optional] Thumbnail float property.
         * @type String (default = "none")

         */
        "float" : null,

        /* [optional] Scale applied to original image for thumbnail.
         * @type Number (default = none).
         * If no thumbscale is given, it is assumed that the thumbnail image will be in a
         * separate file named the same as the original with "_tn" appended to the filename.
         */
        "thumbscale" : null
      }
      </div>

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      To place a slide in your HTML, you need to put a container element in your HTML and then make
      a JS function call to fill in the rest of the details. Let's suppose that you want to put the
      images "gp-slide-1.jpg" and "gp-slide-2.jpg" into a collection and display a thumbnail for just
      the first image. You start by putting two container elements in your HTML and specify ids for
      the elements. The ids can be anything you like as long as they are unique.
      <div class="code-pre">
      &lt;div id="my-picture-1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="my-picture-2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
      At the bottom of your page after you've pulled in all of the requisite JS files, you would
      start another script section and make the function calls to actually fill in the details.
      <div class="code-pre">
      Gp.Slideshow.addSlide("my-picture-1", "addSlide",
        {
          "url" : "gp-slide-1.jpg",
          "caption" : "Dandelions",
          "description" : "Two Dandelions",
          "float" : "right"
          "thumbscale" : "0.5"
        }
      );
      Gp.Slideshow.addSlide("my-picture-2", "addSlide",
        {
          "url" : "gp-slide-2.jpg",
          "description" : "Two ducks in the grass",
          "float" : "hidden"
        }
      );
      </div>
      Note the absence of some of the JSON properties in those calls. The second slide has the float
      property set to <i>"hidden"</i> which means there will be no thumbnail display. Since there is
      no thumbnail display, there is no reason for a "caption" or "thumbscale" property as these
      properties only apply to the thumbnail display.
      <br><br>
      Of course, this is still a lot of code in your HTML file. While the HTML is fairly simple,
      the JS calls are pretty involved and if you have a lot of slides in the file, this script
      section is going to get messy and hard to maintain.
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.Slideshow.fromJSON(jsonURL);</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      <div class="code">
        <div id="gp-slide-1"></div>
        <b>jsonURL</b> - URL of the JSON file to load.
      </div>
      <div class="code-pre">
      {
        /* [required] Group/collection title.
         * @type String
         * Will be used as the LightBox collection name.
         */
        "title" : null,

        /* [optional] Group/collection description.
         * @type String
         */
        "description" : null,

        /* [optional] Common id of all container elements minus the index.
         * @type String (default = "gp-slide")
         */
        "prefix" : null,

        /* [optional] Scale applied to all slides for thumbnail display.
         * @type Number (default = none)
         * Will apply to any slide that doesn't have its own "thumbscale".
         */
        "thumbscale" : null,
        <div id="gp-slide-2"></div>
        /* [required] Slide data.
         * @type Array slide objects
         * Same format as slide object in <i>addSlide</i>
         */
        "data" :
        [
          {
            slide object 1
          },
          {
            slide object n
          }
        ]
      }
      </div>
      Using the <i>fromJSON</i> function, you can layout all of the data for an entire collection
      of slides in a separate JSON file and then make just one JS call in our HTML page to load that
      JSON file.

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      The setup in your HTML is pretty much the same as in <i>addSlide</i> except that the formatting
      of the container element ids is a little more strict. Ideally you will have as many container
      elements in your page as there are slide objects in the JSON file. The id of each element must
      be <i>"prefix-n"</i> where <i>"prefix"</i> is a JSON property and <i>"n"</i> is the 1-based
      index of the slide object in the array. Suppose then that you wanted to put the same two slides
      as in the <i>"addSlide"</i> sample but use a JSON file instead. The JSON in the file would then
      look as follows:
      <div class="code-pre">
      <div id="gp-slide-3"></div>
      {
        "title" : "fromJSON",
        "thumbscale" : "0.4",
        "data" :
        [
          {
            "url" : "gp-slide-1.jpg",
            "caption" : "Dandelions",
            "description" : "Two dandelions",
            "float" : "right"
          },
          {
            "url" : "gp-slide-2.jpg",
            "description" : "Two ducks in the grass",
            "float" : "hidden"
          }
        ]
      }
      </div>
      This is a good place to point out a handy shortcut. If you look back at the documentation for
      the slide JSON object, note that the <i>"url"</i> property is optional. If no url is given,
      it is assumed that the image file is a JPG file and is named the same as the container element
      id. So in this case, we're already taking the default <i>"gp-slide"</i> prefix and our files
      are JPG files named using the prefix. Taking that into account, the JSON can be thinned out a
      bit removing the "url" property.
      <div class="code-pre">
      <div id="gp-slide-4"></div>
      {
        "title" : "fromJSON",
        "thumbscale" : "0.4",
        "data" :
        [
          {
            "caption" : "Dandelions",
            "description" : "Two dandelions",
            "float" : "right"
          },
          {
            "description" : "Two ducks in the grass",
            "float" : "hidden"
          }
        ]
      }
      </div>
      The next step would be to put the container elements in your HTML. The elements don't have to
      be grouped together. The only thing that matters is that they exist and have the correct id
      format. Assuming that you've taken the "gp-slide" default as the prefix, the container would
      look like:
      <div id="gp-slide-5"></div>
      <div class="code-pre">
      &lt;div id="gp-slide-1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="gp-slide-2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
      With the JSON file and the container elements all in place, putting it all together is now
      simply a matter of making a single JavaScript call at the bottom of your page to load the
      file and insert the slides.
      <div class="code">
        Gp.SlideShow.fromJSON("myslides.json");
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">slides.json</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      By taking special care in naming your JSON file, you can make things even easier. When the
      file <i>gp.tools.js</i> is loaded, the location of the page is automatically scanned for a
      file named <i>slides.json</i>. If it is found, then it is loaded automatically.
      <h4>Usage</h4>
      The HTML and the contents of the file are exactly the same as with the <i>fromJSON</i>
      description. Here, however, you make sure the name of the JSON file is <i>slides.json</i>.
      Remove the call to <i>fromJSON</i> from your script section as this will now happen
      automatically.
      <br><br>
      That's it!
    </div>

    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <div class="function-description">
      Like the other utilities, there are some styles included in <i>gp.tools.css</i> that are used
      in the slideshow code. You can use these styles as is or override them where you see fit.
      <br><br>
      When a slide is added to the page, the style <i>"gp-slide-image"</i> is automatically applied
      to the container element (the DIV). The default implementations include in the stock CSS file
      are:
      <div class="code-pre">
      <div id="gp-slide-6"></div>
      .gp-slide-image
      {
        display : inline-block;
        padding : 8px;
        text-align : center;
      }
      .gp-slide-image img
      {
        border : 0;
      }
      </div>
      The display is set to <i>inline-block</i> in order to make the floating work better. A little
      bit of padding is added so that text wrapped around the image doesn't butt right up against
      the image. The text alignment is centered so as to center the caption in the thumbnail. An
      additional style is set such that any images within the container do not display a border.
      <br><br>
      Of course, you are free to change any and all of these properties as you see fit.
