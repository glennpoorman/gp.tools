    <h1>HTML Audio Player</h1>
    <h4>Utilities for displaying audio elements in a page using <i>MediaElement</i></h4>

    Using the audio player utilities, you can create a web page that contains any number of audio
    elements. Setting up the page is a matter of specifying a container element int he HTML for
    every desired audio element and filling in the details using either a JavaScript call or a JSON
    file of audio objects. If the file is named <i>audio.json</i>, it will be automatically loaded
    on document load.

    <div class="function-title">Gp.AudioPlayer.addPlayer(id, audioFile);</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      <h4>Requires <i>MediaElement</i></h4>
      Adds an audio player to the page as a child of the given container element using the data in
      the given JSON audio file object.
      <div class="code">
        <b>id</b> - id of the container element where the audio element will be inserted.<br>
        <b>audioFile</b> - JSON audio file object contains the audio file data.
      </div>
      <div class="code-pre">
      {
        /* [required] Audio file url.
         * @type String
         */
        "url" : null,

        /* [optional] Title.
         * @type String
         */
        "title" : null,

        /* [optional] Artist.
         * @type String
         */
        "artist" : null,

        /* [optional] Album.
         * @type String
         */
        "album" : null,

        /* [optional] Play on load.
         * @type Boolean (default = "false")
         */
        "autoplay" : null,

        /* [optional] Initial volume.
         * @type Integer (0 to 100, default = "80")
         */
        "volume" : null
      }
      </div>

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      To use the <i>addPlayer</i> function, the page needs a container element (preferably a DIV)
      for the audio player and the element must have a unique id.
      <div class="code-pre">
      &lt;div id="some-id"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
      With any container elements in place, the audio elements are inserted by calling the
      <i>addPlayer</i> function for each container at the bottom of the page after all of the
      requisite JS files have been pulled in.
      <div class="code-pre">
      Gp.AudioPlayer.addPlayer("some-id",
        {
          "url" : "gibbon-monkey.mp3",
          "title" : "Gibbon Monkey"
        }
      );
      </div>
      <div id="some-id"></div>
      Note that all but one of the properties in the JSON object are optional. In the absence of
      those properties, <i>autoplay</i> defaults to <i>false</i> and <i>volume</i> defaults to
      <i>80</i>. In the case where the <i>title</i> property is not specified, the default value
      is null which also results in the top portion of the resulting audio player being left off.
      In the sample below, we put the following in the HTML:
      <div class="code-pre">
      &lt;div id="no-title"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
      At the bottom of the page, we made the following call:
      <div class="code-pre">
      Gp.AudioPlayer.addPlayer("no-title",
        {
          "url" : "puppy-barking.mp3"
        }
      );
      </div>
      <div id="no-title"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">Gp.AudioPlayer.fromJSON(jsonURL);</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      <h4>Requires <i>MediaElement</i></h4>
      Loads a series of audio file object from the specified JSON file and add the audio elements
      to elements on the current web page.
      <div class="code">
        <b>jsonURL</b> - url of the JSON file to load.
      </div>
      <div class="code-pre">
      {
        /* [optional] Collection/album title.
         * @type String
         */
        "title" : null,

        /* [optional] Artist.
         * @type String
         */
        "artist" : null,

        /* [optional] Common id of all container elements minus the index.
         * @type String (default = "gp-audio-container")
         */
        "prefix" : null,

        /* [required] Audio file data.
         * @type Array of audio file objects
         * Same format as audio object in <i>addPlayer</i>
         */
        "data" :
        [
          {
            audio object 1
          },
          {
            audio object n
          },
        ]
      }
      </div>
      If you have several audio elements in your page, using <i>addPlayer</i> for each element can
      get quite messy. Using <i>fromJSON</i> allows you to simply put the audio containers in your
      page, define all of the audio objects in a JSON file, and make one call to put it all together.

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      The setup in your HTML is pretty much the same as in <i>addPlayer</i> except that the
      formatting of the container element ids is a little more strict. Ideally you will have as
      many container elements in your page as there are audio file objects in the JSON file. The id
      of each element must be <i>"prefix-n"</i> where <i>"prefix"</i> is a JSON property and
      <i>"n"</i> is the 1-based index of the audio file object in the array. Suppose then that you
      wanted to put three audio objects in your page. You would start by laying out those objects
      in your JSON file as follows.
      <div class="code-pre">
      {
        "title" : "Test Audio",
        "prefix" : "audio-container",
        "data" :
        [
          {
            "title" : "Gibbon Monkey",
            "url" : "gibbon-monkey.mp3"
          },
          {
            "title" : "Puppy Barking",
            "url" : "puppy-barking.mp3"
          },
          {
            "title" : "Rooster",
            "url" : "rooster.mp3"
          }
        ]
      }
      </div>
      The next step would be to put the container elements in your HTML. The elements don't have to
      be grouped together. The only thing that matters is that they exist and have the correct id
      format. Again note the id matches the <i>"prefix"</i> property from the JSON followed by a
      dash and the index of the item in the array.
      <div class="code-pre">
      &lt;div id="audio-container-1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="audio-container-2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="audio-container-3"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </div>
      With the JSON file and the container elements all in place, putting it all together is now
      simply a matter of making a single JavaScript call at the bottom of your page to load the
      file and insert the audio elements.
      <div class="code-pre">
      Gp.AudioPlayer.fromJSON("myaudio.json");
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="function-title">audio.json</div>
    <div class="function-description">
      By taking special care in naming your JSON file, you can make things even easier. When the
      file <i>gp.tools.js</i> is loaded, the location of the page is automatically scanned for a
      file named <i>audio.json</i>. If it is found, then it is loaded automatically.
      <h4>Usage</h4>
      The HTML and the contents of the file are exactly the same as with the <i>fromJSON</i>
      description. Here, however, you make sure the name of the JSON file is <i>audio.json</i>.
      Remove the call to <i>fromJSON</i> from your script section as this will now happen
      automatically.
      <br><br>
      That's it!
      <br><br>
      <div id="audio-container-1"></div>
      <div id="audio-container-2"></div>
      <div id="audio-container-3"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <div class="function-description">
      Like the other utilities, there are some styles included in <i>gp.tools.css</i> that are used
      in the audio player code. You can use these styles as is or override them as you see fit.
      <br><br>
      When an audio player is added to the page, the style <i>.gp-audio-container</i> is automatically
      applied to the container element. The default implementation sets the display type to make the
      element easier to manipulate and float.
      <div class="code-pre">
      .gp-audio-container
      {
        display : table;
      }
      </div>
      Two other styles are also available for modification.
      <div class="code">
        <b>.gp-audio-title</b> - the SPAN element containing the title.<br>
        <b>.mejs-container</b> - the MediaElement container (the actual player).
      </div>
      You can play with these in order to alter things like colors of your display in order to make
      the audio player fit in better with your own site's color choices.
      <br><br>
      In this sample, we slightly altered the bottom margin of the audio container to provide some
      padding in between players.
      <div class="code-pre">
      .gp-audio-container
      {
        margin-bottom : 12px;
      }
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
